This Python project implements a simplified version of the Top Trumps card game using the Pokemon API. The game randomly selects a Pokemon for the player and their opponent, compares chosen stats (such as ID, height, or weight), and determines the winner based on the higher stat. The core features include generating random Pokemon, retrieving Pokemon details from the API, creating a dictionary with essential information, and allowing user input for stat selection. For added complexity, players can choose from different stats, play multiple rounds, and track the overall game outcome.
